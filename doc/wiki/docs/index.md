# Theta
!!! abstract "About Theta"

    _Theta_ is a generic, modular and configurable model checking framework developed at the [Critical Systems Research Group](http://inf.mit.bme.hu/en) of [Budapest University of Technology and Economics](http://www.bme.hu/?language=en), aiming to support the design and evaluation of abstraction refinement-based algorithms for the reachability analysis of various formalisms.
    The main distinguishing characteristic of Theta is its architecture that allows the definition of input formalisms with higher level language front-ends, and the combination of various abstract domains, interpreters, and strategies for abstraction and refinement.
    Theta can both serve as a model checking backend, and also includes ready-to-use, stand-alone tools.
